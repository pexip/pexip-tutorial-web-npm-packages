# Pexip Tutorial: Web NPM Packages

In this tutorial we will learn how to build a videoconferencing app that will work in any device with a browser. This tutorial only have the code examples. The tutorial explaining all the steps and each small detail, can be found in our [Developer Portal](https://developer.pexip.com/docs/category/npm-packages).

## Requirements

Before starting any of these tutorials, you will need to comply with the following requirements:

- **NodeJS and npm:**  You need to install these tools on your system. There are packages for any OS and normally you would install both together.
- **Text editor:** You can use whatever you want, although our recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code.
- **Browser:** You will need a browser with WebRTC support. The recommendation is to use the latest version of Google Chrome.
- **JavaScript and React knowledge:** You will need solid JavaScript knowledge if you want to take advantage of these tutorials. Having some knowledge of React is recommended, but not essential.
- **Access to a Pexip Infinity deployment:** This is the server that the app will use to connect. You could have your own Pexip Infinity deployment or access a demo environment. If you have any doubt about this, contact your Pexip representative.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
